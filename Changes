Add retry_delay & retry_scale as transport attributes
or better to move to DBI transport base class

Add perl-status ui to recent_errors queue

Add more/clearer docs re configuration

Add note about HTTP::Engine - perhaps someone could contribute a driver that
uses it. Would probably want to refactor out parts of the mod_perl transport.

  Enabled use of http persistent-connections by default
    which give significant performance boost by reducing latency.

  Client now warns when retring request afer receiving a 503.

  Add retry with delay with exponential backoff on 503 error.
  Now check_response_hook can throw an exception hash/object
    which can control how the httpd responds to the error.

  Added set of gofer_request & gofer_response pnotes for handlers.

  Moved update_stats() call to PerlCleanupHandler.
  Improved handling of corrupt requests.
  Status now shows distribution of requests per IP address.
  Status now marks and reports duplicate requests.
  Status can now optionally show recent errors.
  Record severe transport errors via update_stats so they can be seen remotely via trace_recent.
  More detailed status reports from track_recent data.
