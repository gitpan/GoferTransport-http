=head1 NAME
    
DBD::Gofer::Transport::http - DBD::Gofer client transport using http

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $remote_dsn = "..."
  DBI->connect("dbi:Gofer:transport=http;url=http://gofer.example.com/gofer;dsn=$remote_dsn",...)

or, enable by setting the DBI_AUTOPROXY environment variable:

  export DBI_AUTOPROXY='dbi:Gofer:transport=http;url=http://gofer.example.com/gofer'

which will force I<all> DBI connections to be made via that Gofer server.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Connect with DBI::Gofer servers that use http transports, i.e., L<DBI::Gofer::Transport::mod_perl>.

This module currently uses the L<LWP::UserAgent> and L<HTTP::Request> modules to manage the http protocol.
The default timeout is undef (unlimited). The LWP::UserAgent C<env_proxy> option is enabled.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

See L<DBD::Gofer::Transport::Base> for a description of the Gofer transport
attributes that are common to all transports, and another common features such
as enabling gofer transport tracing.

The DBD::Gofer::Transport::http transport doesn't add any extra attributes.

=head2 go_timeout

The timeout provided by L<DBD::Gofer::Transport::Base> is used.
The C<go_timeout> value is also passed to LWP::UserAgent as its timeout value.
In practice the DBD::Gofer::Transport::Base timeout would almost certainly fire first.
This area is subject to change in future releases.

=head1 PROTOCOL

The request is sent as a POST with a content type of 'C<application/x-perl-gofer-request-binary>'.

The user-agent string is 'C<DBD::Gofer::Transport::http/><$DBI::VERSION>C</><$VERSION>'.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 transmit_request_by_transport

  $response = $transport->transmit_request_by_transport( $request );

Freezes and transmits the request using the L<LWP::UserAgent> and L<HTTP::Request> modules.
Waits for and returns response. Any exception is caught and returned as a response object.

=head2 receive_response_by_transport

This method isn't used because transmit_request_by_transport() always returns a response object.
If called it throws an exception.

=head2 response_retry_preference

  $retry = $transport->response_retry_preference($request, $response);

The response_retry_preference is called by DBD::Gofer when considering if a
request should be retried after an error.

Returns true (would like to retry), false (must not retry), undef (no preference).

If a true value is returned in the form of a CODE ref then, if DBD::Gofer does
decide to retry the request, it calls the code ref passing $retry_count, $retry_limit.
Currently the called code must return using C<return;>.

=head2 discard_cached_connections

  $transport->discard_cached_connections();

Drops any persistent-connections associated with the transport.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

These environment variables are not considered a stable part of the interface
and they may change between releases. (The general plan is for corresponding
gofer transport attributes to be added. That would enable per-handle
configuration. Patches welcome.)

=head2 DBD_GOFER_CONN_CACHE

Specifies the size of the persistent-conection cache for the transport object.
Default is 10. Set to 0 to disable use of HTTP/1.1 persistent-conections.

=head2 DBD_GOFER_RETRY_WARN

Emit a warn() whenever a request is retried.

=head2 DBD_GOFER_RETRY_BACKOFF_SCALE

Specifies the amount to multiply the retry delay by on each retry.
Default value 2.

=head2 DBD_GOFER_RETRY_DELAY_INIT

Initial delay, in seconds, before retrying after a request receives a 503
response. (The DBD_GOFER_RETRY_BACKOFF_SCALE is applied first, so the actual
initial delay is this value multipled by DBD_GOFER_RETRY_BACKOFF_SCALE).
Default value 0.2.

=head2 DBD_GOFER_RETRY_ON_EMPTY

Used to workaround problems with buggy load balancers (e.g. a Juniper DX with
standing connections enabled) which cause some requests to fail whithout ever
reaching the gofer server.

If set to 1 then empty responses will be retried. If is_idempotent() is true
then upto 20 retries will be performed, else just 1 retry. The retries happen
without any delay and log a warning each time.

If set to a higher value then the retry counts are multiplied by that amount,
so a value of 3 will retry idempotent requests 30 times, for example.

This mechanism is not recommended for non-readonly databases because there's a
risk that the server did receive and act on the request, so retrying it would
cause the database change to be repeated, which may cause other problems.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

There is currently no support for http authentication.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-dbi-gofer-transport-mod_perl@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org>.
